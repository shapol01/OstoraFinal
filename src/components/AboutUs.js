      <h1>THE VISION</h1>
      <p>
        The attraction that will be built up as a result of the league, having
        viewership spanning both Web 2 & Web 3 will allow us to become a
        marketing platform with the ability to showcase what said NFT projects
        are able to provide for a Web 2 audience. The same sentiment is echoed
        for Web 2 companies that are interested in doing marketing on our
        platform with the advantage being a direct bridge between both web
        communities in one place. The business model of sponsorship will aid in
        exponentially scaling the league, reaching new thresholds and attracting
        bigger streamers which will eventually allow the funding and execution
        of real life events for league finals, expos and conferences
      </p>

      <h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>
      <p>
        One key requirement to participate in the tournament is to hold a single
        NFT from any project or blockchain in the hope of onboarding new users
        from web2 in a simple way. This allows them to be part of a bigger
        community
      </p>

      <h1>WHY</h1>
      <p>
        The aim of the tournament is to create entertainment, which will in turn
        create awareness for the Web 3 industry as well as various blockchains.
        This will allow connection and cross-pollination between those
        blockchains, opening the door for conventional and Web 3 gamers to be
        introduced and connected by ways of our tournament via multiple web 2
        and web 3 platforms. The “pull factor” will include well known games
        such as Rocket League, Valiant, League of Legends, PUBG and Call of
        duty, the enticing prize pool, the ability to connect with new people as
        well as an introduction into a new layer of technology that is not
        widely known
      </p>

      <h1>LOGISTICS</h1>
      <p>
        The streamers that we will be scouting will already have a large
        audience so we can quickly gain awareness from their audience, thus
        cementing credibility for the NFT space along with the sponsors from
        both sides. The aim is to have a large pot or prize pool of between five
        to ten thousand dollars for each tournament to successfully attract
        users, both to participate and to watch. The tournament will consist of
        sixteen teams qualified to compete over fifteen weeks with games being
        played on Friday, Saturday and Sunday of every week to maximise
        viewership and participation
